##Linux OS
Linux is open source, meaning...

* run the program, for any purpose.
* study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.
* redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor
* distribute copies of your modified versions to others

Linux gives you complete control, and expects you know what to do with it.
"...flexibility, simplicity, and freedom the foremost considerations when designing and building software systems."

3. To my understanding a VPS is a computer just without the physical aspects of a computer. It still runs an OS and stores files and runs programs, it just doesn't exist in space. Some advantages of this is you can mess around and break things without as many terrible consequences. It's also really secure because if somebody does hack it, they don't have access to your actual computer/database.

4. To my understanding, it's considered a bad idea to run programs from root because of the "Principle fo Least Privelage". Which means that you should only give a program/user enough access or privelage that is required to perform it's function. Vulnerabilites in one program can't be used to effect the rest of the machine.
